I was prompted to create this typing tutor when, while I was myself recently finally learning how to type properly, I was discouraged when the software I chose, while solid in its approach, used some serverside programming that couldn't keep up.

The way the software worked was that if I made an error, the text that I was reading from would turn a different color for the keys I messed up on. But, This would not update fast enough to keep up with my typing, causing me to compound errors when I had an off-by-one error with my fingers. Waiting for the program to keep up seemed like it defeated the purpose, so the solution: make my own damn typing tutor.

Like the version I was inspired by, the user looks at text while typing and the text turns a different color when the user makes an error. Unlike the other tutorial, the text to type is generated randomly, but still focusing on the certain keys pool so that the lesson may be focused.

The biggest plus to my version is that it is purely a front end application so the user will never experience the delays I ws experiencing on the other platform.

The completed version will have the keyboard keys light up, color coded for fingers, and as they are pushed the next key will to be pressed will light up. When the wrong key is pressed, I will have the key itself turn red to inicate an error.

What I would really like, and I'm not to proud to admit my limitations, is transparent hands over the keyboard typing away as I hit the keys. If anyone knows where I can get the transparent-hand art and have a way I can interact with it I will be your best friend.
